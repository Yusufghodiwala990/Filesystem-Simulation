# Filesystem-Simulation
Creating a Filesystem structure in C# using a Leftmost-child Right-Sibling Tree. In UNIX and UNIX oriented OS's, a filesystem is a central component of the OS. Simulating it requires the use of a Leftmost-Child Right-Sibling Tree. In this tree, a leftmost-child references a sub-directory of a directory and it's right-sibling being the directories that are at the same level as the leftmost-child. This creates a somewhat staircase struture. The root of the tree is the root of the filesystem. If we are viewing this n-ary tree from a typical Binary Tree standpoint, then the parent node can have n children. The first child of any particular parent is it's leftmost-child, and subsequent directories at that same level will have right sibling references.

(Note : The blue lines represent rightsibling references, meaning directories are at the SAME level as the leftmostchild in the sequence. E.g 'F' is in the same folder as 'B' but 'N' is a subdirectory of 'H')
